# Scot_covid19
Text files (CSV) containing results of Covid-19 testing in Scotland. 

## Source
The source of data from 06 March to 13 March 2020 is the [Internet Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/search.php?query=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.scot%2Fcoronavirus-covid-19%2F). From 14 March 2020 the data is sourced directly from the Scottish Government's [webpage](https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/), and for now is manually added.

A friend supplied me with data from 24 Jan 2020 to 6th March to fill in gaps. 

I am currently looking for an API similar to Public Health England's one to automate updates. 

## Other data
I've added the Health Board codes from the [NHS Scotland Open Data Store](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/geography-codes-and-labels/resource/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc). 

I've also added a July 2019 [poulation estimate file](HB_pop_est_2019.csv) from [NHS Scotland Open Data Store](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/population-estimates/resource/27a72cc8-d6d8-430c-8b4f-3109a9ceadb1). Both are published under OGL.

## Other resources
I also recommend Tom White's Github repo [Covid-19-UK-Data](https://github.com/tomwhite/covid-19-uk-data) which is broader and more code-driven for now. We may start collaborating / merging these.
